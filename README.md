# noflash - chrome extension

Speed up your browsing disabling not only flash, but any heavy object element that may slow down the page load and rendering (pdf, ads, etc).

### Re-enabling
These objects (flash, pdf, etc) will be replaced with a button you can click to load the original stuff anytime you want while seeing the page.

### White List
Edit your personal white list of sites to always allow flash, pdf, etc.
Nice defaults are included: youtube.com, google.com, facebook.com, vimeo.com.
